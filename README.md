## HTML Structure Overview

### 1. Styles and Theme
The extension employs a clean design using CSS variables for consistent theming:

- **Mode-specific Controls**: Dynamic UI components that adapt based on the selected mode.
- **Settings Panel**: Adjustable sliders and dropdowns for personalization.
- **Result and History Display**: Container for displaying generated content and interaction history.

## Technical Details

### API Integration
The extension leverages Google's Generative Language API for advanced AI features. To utilize the API:
1. Obtain an API key from Google Cloud.
2. Replace `YOUR-API-KEY` in the `main.js` file with your API key:
    ```javascript
    const API_KEY = 'YOUR-API-KEY';
    ```

### JavaScript Breakdown
- **Event Listeners**: Listeners are set up for DOM elements to handle user inputs, mode selection, and button interactions.
- **Mode Management**: Mode-specific behaviors are managed through a combination of switch cases and CSS display toggling.
- **API Calls**: The `callGeminiAPI()` function formats user inputs based on the selected mode and sends a POST request to the API.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for character limits, API failures, and network issues.
- **Clipboard Copy**: Provides a button to copy generated responses to the clipboard with user feedback.

## Permissions
The extension requires the following permissions:
- `activeTab`: Access the current tab for AI interaction.
- `contextMenus`: Add options to the right-click context menu.
- `storage`: Save and retrieve history data using Chrome's local storage or `localStorage` as a fallback.
- `scripting`: Inject scripts when needed.
- `host_permissions`: Access Google's Generative Language API for AI-powered features.

## Development Setup
1. Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. To modify and test, follow the manual installation steps above.
4. Open the developer console in Chrome (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Opt+I`) to view logs and debug.
